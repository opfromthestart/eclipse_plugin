# eclipse_plugin
Plugin logic for the server eclipseanarchy.org.

Plugin runs on 1.18.2 Spigot, and requires ProtocolLib to run.

Needs Spigot API, CraftBukkit, Brigadier, ProtocolLib, GSON, and Guava to run.

https://github.com/google/guava

The goal is to replace all of the current plugins of Eclipse Anarchy with this one. If other servers use this plugin I will be open to helping implement requested features.
